Dear {{usr_name}},As to make you clear understand about your loan repayment progress, please be reminded the next installment amount HK${{instalment_amount}} will be due on {{due_date}}.  Make sure to maintain sufficient fund in your registered bank account for direct debit of the next installment.  If your DDA setup instruction is still processing by the bank, the installment amount should be transferred to our Hang Seng Bank Account (024) {{hang_seng_bank_account}} before the due date and the bank receipt for the installment should be uploaded or emailed to us as to avoid any unnecessary service charge incurred.  For you have any question about your repayment scheme, please reply to this email or call our customer service manager at 2111 0991.Yours faithfully,The Zwap Team
